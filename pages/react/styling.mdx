# Styling

There are _many_ different ways to style React components. The React community hasn't settled on one "best" way to style components, and new style libraries are created frequently. The method you choose is often based on personal preference, since the features of each method are generally pretty similar.

We'll look at three broad approaches:

- Inline styles
- CSS and class names
- CSS-in-JS

When just getting started with React, I recommend using inline styles for simplicity, and choosing something else when you have a better sense of your requirements.
