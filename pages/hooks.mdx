# Hooks

We've already had a brief introduction to Hooks in Chapter 3.5 with Events, but now let's examine it more carefully. 

Hooks refer to a set of library functions provided by React that allows the developer to handle UI state in a cleaner and more functional way. 

We can define state as set of data in the application that is mutable over time (or by user interaction) and is kept within the confines of a React component. 

For example, recall the CounterButton example. 

<Example code={nativeEvent} />

The CounterButton component returns a JSX object with an HTML button that has a JavaScript onClick callback function that calls a function setCount with the argument count + 1. count and setCount are declared and initialized by line 5 using the useState hook in React. 

When a user clicks the Button on the site, nothing is changed in the code. Instead, the data on the application is changed by useState.

Let's dive deeper into how useState works.
