# Hooks

We've already had a brief introduction to Hooks in Events chapter, but now let's examine it more carefully. 

Hooks refer to a set of library functions provided by React that allows the developer to handle UI state in a cleaner and more functional way. 

We can define state as set of data in the application that is mutable over time (or by user interaction) and is kept within the confines of a React component. 

## Built-in hooks

In this section, we'll look at the following hooks in more detail:

- **`useState`** - Persist state within a component function
- **`useReducer`** - Similar to useState, but can be used for complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values
- **`useEffect`** - Performs a function call when the component renders
- **`useRef`** - Create and store a mutable variable for the full lifetime of the component
- **`useContext`** - Accepts a context object and returns its values - useful for Theme UI, authentication
- **`Custom Hooks`** - Build our own!

## Quick look

For example, recall the CounterButton example. 

<Example code={nativeEvent} />

The CounterButton component has an onClick function that calls setCount with the argument count + 1. count and setCount are declared and initialized by line 5 using the useState hook in React. 

When a user clicks the Button on the site, the data in this component is changed by useState.

Let's dive deeper into how useState works.
