# JSX

JSX is an extension to the JavaScript language that adds a new kind of _expression_, the **JSX expression**, used to create React elements (which we'll cover soon).

We create a React element using the API `React.createElement(type, props, children)` â€” JSX expressions are a concise syntax for calling this API.

## Syntax

We can use JSX expressions anywhere we could use any other expression, e.g. in a return statement or variable assignment:

<Example
  title={'JSX Example'}
  transpilerTitle={'Babel-compiled output'}
  panes={['editor', 'transpiler']}
  code={jsx}
/>

> On the right in the example above, we can see how our JSX expressions are compiled by babel.

When a JSX element wraps to multiple lines, we often write it when parentheses around it, since it looks nicer.

## How it works

JSX is tag-based like XML. Each tag, e.g. `<div />`, is transformed into a call to `React.createElement('div')`. In this case, `'div'` is the **type** of the element.

Any _attributes_ become **props** of the instantiated component. The value of an attribute can be a string, like `foo="hello"`, or it can be any JavaScript expression when wrapped in curly braces, as in `bar={baz}` (which would set the value of the `bar` prop to `baz`).

If we want to create an element with children elements, the children should go between the opening tag, `<div>`, and closing tag `</div>`. Elements without children can using a self-closing tag, like `<div />`, as a shorthand.

## Why JSX?

The XML-like syntax is typically more concise, easier to read, and visually looks a little like the generated UI (both are tree-like). We don't _have to_ use JSX, but there are few disadvantages, so we probably should use it.
